# TheInitializer
# Flask App/Bootstrap Initialization

A python script that creates basic Flask app templates with chosen bootstrap example templates. 

## Getting Started

The project is simple to use and easy to get up and running. 

### Prerequisites

You'll want to make sure you have Flask installed on your computer. I recommend creating a virtual environment in your Flask directory once you clone it. The project comes with a .gitignore file that excludes the __pycache__ file, as well as the env/ folder if you choose to use a virtual environment.


### Installing

First things first!

Clone the repo

```
git clone 
```

## Running the program

Simply run the launcher and follow the command prompt

```
python launcher.py
```

Once the project has been created

cd into the project folder and create your virtual environment and activate it

After that you should install Flask

```
pip install Flask
```
Now just run the usual commands to get the flask app going

```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```
then run it
```
flask run
```
